# Bulls and Cows

## Description
This project is an advanced version of the classic code-breaking game "Bulls and Cows". The game involves two players: one who sets a secret code and another who tries to guess it. The code consists of unique digits, and the guess is graded based on the number of bulls and cows. This project helps you learn integer arithmetic, generate random numbers, store data in data structures, and handle errors.

## Dépôt GitHub
The source code for this project is available on GitHub: [JetBrains Academy Graduate Java project Bulls and Cows](https://github.com/MorgunovE/JetBrains_Academy_Graduate_Java_project_Bulls_and_Cows)

## Fonctionnalités
- Simulate the gameplay to get familiar with the process.
- Implement the grading mechanism.
- Create a simple random number generator.
- Make a fully functional classic version of the game.
- Rewrite the random number generator using built-in Java tools.
- Improve the code generator to make the game more difficult.
- Handle various errors to make the application more stable.
